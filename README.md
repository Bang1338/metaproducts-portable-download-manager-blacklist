## Question and Answer

#### Why blacklist?
* Theory 1: Prevent some piracy team
* Theory 2: Prevent using the name from MetaProducts Team or some personal infomation
* Theory 3: idk

#### Where to download?
[Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/982277729699364914/1054176730379722874/pdmsetup.exe), thank to r0ger for this.

#### Where are they?
The blacklist is encoded in the exe file. I wish it's was .NET, but it's not, it's Borland Delphi.

For quick, my friend [r0ger](https://github.com/r0ger888) did a list of blacklisted name and embed in his keygen, see [here](https://github.com/r0ger888/metaproducts-portable-download-manager-3.8.827-keygen/blob/main/blacklist.inc)
* First, the exe is packed with ASPack, we have to unpack first.
* Second, fire up IDA Pro (keep in mind the app is 32bit.)
* Third, find `sub_7D5DD0` and you'll see the bunch of blacklisted name.
